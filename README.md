This was a coding exercise a friend gave me thats im sharing on here.

Your objective is to implement Francis, a simple message responder that responds as follows:                                                                                                                                              
* Francis answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question
* He answers 'Chill!' if you yell at him using all capital letters
* He says 'See if I care!' if you address him without actually saying anything
* He answers 'Whatevs.' to anything else
